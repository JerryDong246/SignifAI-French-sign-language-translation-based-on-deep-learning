### 🧩 Overview
**SignifAI** is an engineering-driven research project that translates French Sign Language (LSF/FSL) into French text and speech using deep learning and large language models.  
It bridges accessibility and technology through multimodal AI — combining gesture recognition and linguistic modeling.

---

### ✨ Features
- 🎥 Real-time and offline inference  
- 🧩 Training and evaluation scripts  
- ⚙️ Configurable model architectures (CNN, LSTM, Transformer)  
- 💬 Demo web interface (Gradio / Streamlit)
